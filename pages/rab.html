            Summer code slinging internship! <span class="intro">RAB Lighting</span> is a company that has any lighting
            and fixture solution you could dream of. As their sole developer, I was tasked with rewriting their aging
            back orders system and writing a snazzy new calculator feature on the website. I only had a little
            experience with JavaScript and no experience with PHP or SQL at the time. I had to learn fast!

        <div class="carousel-container">

        <p>
            The Pole Capacity Calculator was a fun one to write. It was a page that let users choose a pole and average
            wind
            speed and they could then add different lighting fixtures to the pole and it would calculate if the pole
            could
            support their selections.
        </p>

        <p>
            Its data was populated from a few SQL queries in the PHP backend. All page interactions
            were written in vanilla JavaScript (I wasn't a fan of libraries yet because they bogged down the already
            snail-slow
            JavaScript engines browsers were sporting back then (at least on my Pentium III 128MB RAM work computer!)).
            Changing
            dropdown options changed the values the calculations were run against.
        </p>

        <p>
            The fun part was the fixture name
            autocompletion. Typing in a fixture's name would provide autocomplete results like you see in browsers
            everywhere
            now. I had just learned about trees and binary search in my data structures class the previous semester. I
            wrote
            a
            Node class and a Tree class and the list of fixtures was fed in which was sorted alphabetically.
            Autocomplete
            was
            then as simple as running a binary tree search after every letter typed. This ran surprisingly instant... I
            was
            expecting slow chugging calculations as the user types!

            <h3>Back Orders System</h3>
        </header>

        <div class="carousel-container">
            <div class="carousel" data-width="528" data-height="281">
                <img src="/pages/rab/main.png"/>
                <img src="/pages/rab/loading.png"/>
                <img src="/pages/rab/modal.png"/>
                <img src="/pages/rab/selectbox.png"/>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
            The internal back orders system was an old and slow system that took around 20 seconds to load each page. I
            couldn't
            believe none of the company's employees had gone crazy using it! All actions on the page required a page
            reload,
            so
            it made sense to make the data dynamically loaded so we can play with it without needing to load the page
            all
            over
            again.
        </p>

        <p>
            By having the page data load through AJAX, the page would display immediately, and once the data was
            displayed,
            the
            user could sort the data by column instantly.
        </p>

        <p>
            I added a modal window to display more detailed information about each product order where before it was
            sending
            the
            user to another page.
        </p>

        <p>
            Updating the order status was quick and seamless by clicking on the status and choosing a new status. The
            updated
            status would be sent asynchronously in the background and the data in the frontend was updated.
        </p>

        <p>
            I rewrote some really inefficient SQL queries (SELECT * FROM...) which reduced overhead by a lot and shaved
            a lot of loading time off. Surprisingly, the biggest culprit for the 20 second page load time was rendering
            the
            table rows. The original page used Prototype.js which I found, through JS profiling, added a huge overhead
            for
            every
            function call it wrapped. The other culprit was rendering one row at a time as data was iterated over.
            Building
            up
            an HTML string and rendering it all at once was far faster. In the end, I was able to shave the page load
            time
            down
            to around 3 seconds. It was a company hit!
