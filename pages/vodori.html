            <a href="http://www.vodori.com" target="_blank" title="Vodori">Vodori</a> is a digital marketing agency
            located right in the heart of Chicago. They deliver online strategy, creative, and software solutions to a
            range of clients from small mom and pop shops to Fortune 100 companies. Armed with Vodori's flagship CMS and
            marketing platform, Pepper, they strive to provide clients with an easy to use and modern interface for
            managing the content on their websites as well as marketing materials.

            I was both a back end developer as well as a front end developer at Vodori depending on which project I was
            working on. While working on our client site implementations, I learned a great deal about software
            engineering principles and methodologies as well as system administration. We did our own site deployments,
            so getting familiar with setting up server environments was a must. We used a multi-tier architecture for a
            greater separation of concerns over plain MVC. I grew very fond of test-driven development during my time as
            a back end developer.

            My time as a front end developer at Vodori was more exploratory: exploring the new technologies that are out
            there and learning and discovering best practices and design patterns in the wild west of JavaScript. A lot
            of effort was spent keeping up to date with all the libraries and methods out there because of the
            fast-changing nature of the web. We mostly used the Dojo Toolkit and because we were on the cutting edge, I
            was actively engaged in Github helping them find and fix bugs. All of this allowed us to create an immensely
            powerful front end interface for Vodori's Pepper.
