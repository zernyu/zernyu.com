            <a href="/oldprojects/grababike" title="Grab a Bike Demo" target="_blank" class="intro">Grab a Bike</a> was
            an ambitious school project to research and develop a sustainable bike sharing program for the University of
            Illinois campus, much like Chicago's Divvy Bikes and New York's Citi Bikes. It spanned three semesters and
            had some motivated students behind the project to develop prototypes and reach out to the student body as
            well as the campus transportation service. Unfortunately, like many college projects, everyone graduates and
            moves on to other things.

            I took on the task to design and develop the website for the project. The goal was to create a clean and
            inviting website that didn't overwhelm the visitor and provided just the right amount of information to get
            our point across. Being a student of Computer Science, I was running Linux at the time, so my design tools
            of choice were of course GIMP and Inkscape :). I would later find out that my little Eee PC did not render
            true colors, so the high contrast of the site is due to trying to reach the right colors on my muted 10"
            screen!

            The only real technical aspect of the site was writing a quick Twitter RSS feed parser in PHP, which is now
            defunct due to the new Twitter API. All in all, a quick and dirty job!
