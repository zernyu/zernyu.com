            <span class="intro">Music Muse</span> was a quick experimental concept project I worked on at school to
            explore what an online music aggregator could be like. It scraped electronic music blogs that shared mp3
            files and listed the tracks in an interface very similar to iTunes.
        </p>

        <p>
            Though it's not very functional anymore (music copyright laws!), you can still
            <a href="/oldprojects/musicmuse" title="Music Muse Demo" target="_blank"> take a look</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Music Muse was both an experiment in interface design and also a way of laying out PHP templates in tiles or
            fragments, which I have learned in later years is a ubiquitous pattern in all templating engines. Nobody is
            original, right? :)
        </p>

        <p>
            The interface is a conglomeration of various PHP templates that focus on displaying and doing one thing
            only. All actions that POST in the background are simple PHP files that are called and run.
        </p>

        <p>
            The goal of Music Muse was for all interactions to be as quick and seamless as possible, so that the app
            feels almost like a native desktop app. I only spent a few days on it, so the usability is not close to
            where I would like it.
