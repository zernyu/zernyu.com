            <span class="intro">Alpha Phi Omega</span> is a national service fraternity for college students. It
            revolves around doing community service projects, with service requirements for all members and pledges to
            stay active each semester. Service projects span a whole variety of scale and involvement, with projects to
            serve the school Campus, the local Community, the Alpha Phi Omega Chapter, or the Country. Because there is
            such a wealth of available service projects, scheduling these projects with a chapter of 100 students can
            become pretty demanding. Before I joined, the local chapter had been scheduling events with a giant binder.
            Members had to find the binder to see what events were available and to sign up for them. Communication and
            management was a challenge, to say the least.
        </p>

        <p>
            When I pledged at Alpha Phi Omega, my friend
            <a href="http://will-meister.com/" title="Will Meister" target="_blank">Will</a>
            had just thrown together a quick site on Ruby on Rails to handle simple event scheduling and member profiles
            with contact info. The site was slow, but functional, and completely spoiled me for never having to deal
            with the giant binder! When I became the chapter's website administrator and Will moved on to become the
            chapter president, he handed me the codebase and that was when I dove headfirst into the world of software
            engineering.
        </p>

        <p>
            I had never heard of a software design pattern before, much less know what MVC was. The extent of my web
            programming knowledge consisted of a few PHP scripts and simple SQL queries and the occasional AJAX call.
            Will, being the really busy guy he is, and having an insanely short deadline to get a functioning site put
            out, was just as lost as I was, it turns out. Following tradition of how the site was conceived, it
            continued to be a work-in-progress sandbox for testing out (bad) ideas and learning from mistakes the hard
            way (working directly off production ;)).
        </p>

        <p>
            By the time I graduated and relinquished my baby, the chapter was able to swell to almost three times (past
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number" title="Dunbar's number" target="_blank">Dunbar's
                number</a>!) the amount of members it used to be able to manage due to the reduced overhead of having
            many of the chapter's chores automated.

            <h3>Events</h3>
        </header>

        <div class="carousel-container">
            <div class="carousel" data-width="768" data-height="537">
                <img src="/pages/apo/eventview.png" alt="View Event"/>
                <img src="/pages/apo/eventcreate.png" alt="Create Event"/>

        <p>
            Being in Alpha Phi Omega meant a part of your life revolved around attending many events that would earn you
            special points you needed to acquire to become or stay an active member that year. These requirements used
            to be as simple as doing 20 community service hours within the semester, but once the chapter switched to
            using a website that logged every members' activities, members of the exec board realized they could create
            new and creative requirements for members. And creative they were!
        </p>

        <p>
            The events aspect of the site was used for any and all events, from service projects and weekly meetings to
            pot luck dinners and spring break Habitat for Humanity trips. It let the event managers easily coordinate
            events because all attendees' contact info was easily available and they could quickly approve attendance
            after the event with a few clicks. Events could have points added to them that attendees would earn for
            going
            to them, such as community service hours, leadership hours, and fellowship hours.
        </p>

        <p>
            To make event managers' lives easier, I added in some automation to the event sign-up process. Attendees
            were notified by email a few hours before the event was about to begin. There was a wait list that would
            automatically bump members in the wait list to the attendee list if someone else dropped out and it would
            notify the member that they've been moved off the wait list. The wait list had logic that would give members
            with cars priority over other members if the event was short on drivers. This helped immensely in making
            sure everyone signed up was able to get to the event.

            <h3>Members</h3>
        </header>

        <div class="carousel-container">
            <div class="carousel" data-width="768" data-height="599">
                <img src="/pages/apo/memberview.png" alt="View Member"/>
                <img src="/pages/apo/members.png" alt="Current Members"/>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
            The most complicated part of the site was the members portion of the site. The site kept track of every
            event each member had ever signed up for, so that people could keep track of their requirements progress as
            well as have their Alpha Phi Omega career total service hours to put on their resumes. Calculating each
            member's stats was quite complex due to different member statuses having different requirements; pledges had
            to complete different requirements compared to active members who had differing requirements from members on
            the executive board. Members could also be penalized for not showing up to events they signed up for by
            having their total required service hours increased for the semester.
        </p>

        <p>
            Requirements were also changed and updated each semester as the exec committee changed members and new
            members brought in new ideas. What started out as just requiring members to complete a certain amount of
            community service hours and attending enough weekly meetings became requiring members to attend a more
            diverse selection of events so that attendance was more spread out among different events. We were able to
            require members to have to attend every type of service event - chapter, campus, community, country - as
            well as letting members choose between being drivers or being part of one of the chapters' many various
            committees. Exec board members were required to submit a semester's end report so that the new chair members
            of the next semester would be able to pick up where they left off.
        </p>

        <p>
            All of this required large amounts of calculations every time member data was retrieved for the website, so
            I had to aggressively cache pages as well as store precalculated member values in the database for faster
            retrieval. It was a challenge to keep values up to date while making sure as many values were cached and
            stored as possible as to avoid unnecessary calculations. For a long time, the site was very slow to respond,
            with pages taking over a minute to load! How embarassing :)
